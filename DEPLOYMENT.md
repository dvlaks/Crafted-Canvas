# Vercel Deployment Checklist

## Pre-deployment Steps

1. ✅ **Build locally first**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. ✅ **Test production build**
   ```bash
   npm run preview
   ```

3. ✅ **Check for missing assets**
   - All image files should exist
   - No .placeholder files should be referenced

4. ✅ **Verify configuration files**
   - `vercel.json` is configured correctly
   - `package.json` has correct build script
   - No missing dependencies

## Fixed Issues for This Deployment

1. ✅ **Fixed missing hero background**
   - Updated `tailwind.config.js` to use gradient instead of missing image
   - Removed reference to `/src/assets/herobg.png`

2. ✅ **Added error boundaries**
   - App-level error boundary to catch deployment issues
   - Enhanced Three.js error handling
   - Better Suspense fallbacks

3. ✅ **Enhanced Resume component**
   - Added proper error handling for skills data
   - Improved debugging and fallback handling

4. ✅ **Updated Vercel configuration**
   - Added security headers
   - Optimized for React SPA routing

## Deployment Commands

```bash
# If using Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel
vercel --prod

# Or push to connected Git repository for auto-deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Fix deployment issues with error boundaries and missing assets"
git push origin main
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Blank page on deployment**: Usually caused by missing assets or JavaScript errors
2. **3D components not loading**: Fixed with error boundaries and fallbacks
3. **Missing images**: Check all asset paths and replace placeholders

## Post-deployment Verification

1. Check that all sections load properly
2. Verify navigation works
3. Test Resume tabs functionality
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Test on different devices/browsers
